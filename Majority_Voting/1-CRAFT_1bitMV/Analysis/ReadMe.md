To evaluate the design, we made use of VerFI(ver 2 Beta) for diagnosis (https://github.com/emsec/VerFI/tree/master/VerFI_for_attack). This analysis contains the following files:

- Library.txt: this file includes the specification of cells used in NANG45 ASIC library

- design.v: this file is the net-list of the RTL code, which has been synthesized by Design Compiler using NANG45 ASIC standard cell library. Note that the ungrouped net-list should be generated.

- cells.rpt: it is one of the reports generated by the synthesizer (Design Compiler). It lists all cells available in the design and their hierarchy.

- sim.txt: it defines all simulation settings. In particular, it sets the tool to inject single-bit sruck-at-1 fault into the "done" signal at the second clock cycle.

The result of the simulation (which took a couple of seconds using 30 CPU cores) can be seen in the "SimulationResult" folder. The 3-instance MV design (for 1-bit correction) can be easily attacked by sniffing the output of a middle round by injecting a single stuck-at fault at a part of the voting circuit responsible
for the DONE signal. In this example, the second round output value can be seen in "Result.txt", which can easily reveal the secret.
