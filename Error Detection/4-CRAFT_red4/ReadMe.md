To evaluate the design, we made use of VerFI(ver 2 Beta) for diagnosis (https://github.com/emsec/VerFI/tree/master/VerFI_for_attack). This analysis contains the following files:

- design.v: this file is the net-list of the RTL code(https://github.com/emsec/ImpeccableCircuits/tree/master/CRAFT/3-CRAFT_red4), which has been synthesized by Design Compiler using NANG45 ASIC standard cell library. Note that the ungrouped net-list should be generated.

- cells.rpt: it is one of the reports generated by the synthesizer (Design Compiler). It lists all cells available in the design and their hierarchy.

- sim.txt: it defines all simulation settings. In particular, it sets the tool to inject three-bit stuck at 0 fault into the S-box of the design at the 29th clock cycle.

The result of the simulation (which took a couple of seconds using 30 CPU cores) can be seen in the "SimulationResult" folder. The "Result.txt" can be used for mounting SIFA.
