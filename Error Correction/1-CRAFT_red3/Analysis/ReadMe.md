To evaluate the design, we made use of VerFI(ver 2 Beta) for diagnosis (https://github.com/emsec/VerFI/tree/master/VerFI_for_diagnosis). This analysis contains the following files:

- design.v: this file is the net-list of the RTL code, which has been synthesized by Design Compiler using NANG45 ASIC standard cell library. Note that the ungrouped net-list should be generated.

- cells.rpt: it is one of the reports generated by the synthesizer (Design Compiler). It lists all cells available in the design and their hierarchy.

- sim.txt: it defines all simulation settings. In particular, it sets the tool to inject every possible single-bit toggle fault into the design at the 10th clock cycle. Module "Output_MUX" is excluded.

The result of the simulation (which took a couple of seconds using 30 CPU cores) can be seen in the "SimulationResult" folder. The results show that among all fault injections, 1 case led to "detected" due to targeting the "done" signal. Other faults have been corrected by design.
